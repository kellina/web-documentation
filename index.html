            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                language.
                Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                its
                environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p> JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language
                elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="what_you_should_already_know">
            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the
                    main
                    page about JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>


        <section class="main-section" id="javaScript_and_java">
            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows
                most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason
                why
                it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes,
                and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                you
                do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
                typed.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                code:</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) {  alert("Hello " + yourName);  }
greetMe("World");</code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters
                can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A"
                through
                "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p> With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code>var x = 42.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code>x = 42.</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="variable_scope">
        <header>Variable scope</header>
        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available
            to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a
            local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="global_variables">
        <header>Global variables</header>
        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so
            you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
        <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by
            specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
            document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
        </section>    

        <section class="main-section" id="constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the
            same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
            alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be
            initialized to a value.</p>
        <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
            omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                <ul>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                    <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                    <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with
            your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think
            of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
        </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="if_else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to
            execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
        <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
        <p>You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as
            follows:</p>
        <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while
            statement looks as follows:</p>
        <code>while (condition) statement</code>
        <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement
            following the loop.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="function_declarations">
        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function
            keyword, followed by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
            <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to
            return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies
            the value returned by the function.</p>
        <code>return number * number;</code>
        <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
            function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or
            in the calling function.</p>
